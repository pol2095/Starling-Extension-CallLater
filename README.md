# Starling Extension CallLater 1.1.0

This project adds a callLater method to Starling Framework like Apache Flex. Starling Framework offering blazing fast GPU powered graphics to create a smooth and responsive experience. Build completely standalone, native applications on iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac OS X, or target Adobe Flash Player in desktop browsers.<br />
The callLater() method queues an operation to be performed for the next screen refresh, rather than in the current update. Without the callLater() method, you might try to access a property of a component that is not yet available.
